# Python-in-building-science
This is a work in progress repository for teaching purposes. Examples will be uploaded gradually.

## Basic Notes
Make sure that Python 3 is installed. If you use Visual Studio Code, the following steps would be helpful
* Check the Python version in the terminal `python3 --version` (if you are using the new Python, you might need to use `py --version`
* Install the missing packages using `python3 -m pip install #{the package name}` (e.g., `python3 -m pip install pandas`) - Similarly for new Python, you might need to use `py` rather than `python3`
* Set the Python interpreter correctly with clicking on `Command` & `Shift` & `P` all together and then select ` Python: Select Interpreter' as the following image shows:

* After that in the bottom right you should see the compiler listed as Python:

## Example 1: City of Chicago Benchmarking Analysis
This example provides a jump start for the CAE 465_526 students to conduct a comparative analysis between different city benchmarking databases. The code is available [here](https://github.com/berg-lab/Python-in-building-science/tree/main/Building%20energy%20benchmarking)


## Example 2: Outdoor Weather Data
This example provides a jump start to donwload outdoor weather data from Weather Wunderground. The readme is available [here](https://github.com/berg-lab/Python-in-building-science/blob/main/Weather%20wunderground/README.md).

## Example 3: Energy Modeling Calibration using CVRMSE and NMBE Calculation 
This example shows how to caculate CVRMSE and NMBE metrics using ASHRAE Guideline 14 when the metered data is available. The code is available [here](https://github.com/berg-lab/Python-in-building-science/tree/main/Energy%20model%20calibration)
