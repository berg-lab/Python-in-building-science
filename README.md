# Python-in-building-science
This is a work in progress repository for teaching purposes. Examples will be uploaded gradually.

## Basic Notes
Make sure that Python 3 is installed. If you use Visual Studio Code, the following steps would be helpful
* Check the Python version in the terminal `python3 --version` (if you are using the new Python, you might need to use `py --version`
* Install the missing packages using `python3 -m pip install #{the package name}` (e.g., `python3 -m pip install pandas`) - Similarly for new Python, you might need to use `py` rather than `python3`

## Example 1: City of Chicago Benchmarking Analysis
